# Identifying Opportunities and Concepts for Creative Workers  

In early 2017, I designed and lead 6 workshops with customers in creative fields. My team was in the front-end phases of design: We hadn't yet identified what we should build or in what order. We needed to identify problems, and understand which opportunities would be the highest impact to solve for our creative customers. 

## Goals 

- Identify the most irksome or painful parts of people's workflows  
- Create concepts that met the needs we identified, and prioritize which would be perceived most useful for our audience 
- _[Internally]_ Anchor a recently assembled team on real user problems firsthand, and stoke enthusiasm for solving the issues we uncovered
- _[Personally]_ Pilot participatory design-inspired methods in a workshop format


## Approach  
This was the first time I'd tried co-design methods in a workshop format with people external to the company. I chose this format because it's inclusive: The whole team could attend and talk to customers firsthand. Co-creative research is also a great candidate for generative, strategic research – anytime we're determining what to build, and in what order. So, I designed workshops for 3 groups that ran in 2-part sessions:
