# Identifying Opportunities and Concepts for Creative Workers  

In early 2017, I designed and lead 6 workshops with customers in creative fields. My team was in the front-end phases of design: We hadn't yet identified what we should build or in what order. We needed to identify problems, and understand which opportunities would be the highest impact to solve for our creative customers. 

## Goals 

- Identify the most taxing parts of people's workflows  
- Create concepts designed for the needs we identified
- Prioritize which concepts were most promising, balancing customer needs and Dropbox priorities
- _[Internally]_ Anchor a recently assembled team on real user problems firsthand, and stoke enthusiasm for solving the issues we uncovered
- _[Personally]_ Pilot participatory design-inspired methods in a workshop format


## Approach  
I chose to use workshops because they're inclusive for customers and teammates. The whole team could attend and talk to customers firsthand; and customers would have peers in the room to share the experience with. Co-creative research is also a great candidate for generative, strategic research – anytime we're determining what to build, and in what order. So, I designed workshops for 3 groups that ran in 2-part sessions: 

### Part I: Identify Problems & Prioritize Opportunities  

1. **Socialize Internal Participation**<br>I was embedded on the team so I had enough context to have informal conversations with the team about their needs and expectations. I socialized and evangelized the workshops so I could encourage cross-functional participation. This included 1-1 and 1-many meetings discussing the methods and goals, and encouraging people to join in.<br><br>
1. **Design, Prep, and Test Materials**<br>One of the most challenging parts of co-creative design is creating the materials that enable people outside the design team to participate. I designed instructional and participatory assets. For the primary activity, I adapted a day-in-the-life excecise to have participants map a project. Here's an example that resulted from an internal pilot: <br> ![Example project map](/images/pilotmap.png)<br><br>  
1. **Recruit Participants**<br>Recruiting for co-creative research is a bit different. Rather than look for the average customer in our market, I needed to recruit people that were vocal and more opinionated about what wasn't working in their processes. I also needed people that were open to participate in a design workshop, which creates a bias for who we can recruit. I designed a screener and email that emphasized what people would get out of the workshop: Exposure to design thinking methods, a way to tell us directly what they needed to work the way they wanted, and a chance to network with people in their field also looking for best practices. <br><br>
