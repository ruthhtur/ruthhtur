# Identifying Opportunities and Concepts for Creative Workers  

In early 2017, I designed and lead 6 workshops with customers in creative fields. My team was in the front-end phases of design: We hadn't yet identified what we should build or in what order. We needed to identify problems, and understand which opportunities would be the highest impact to solve for our creative customers. 

## Goals 

- Identify the most taxing parts of people's workflows  
- Create concepts designed for the needs we identified
- Prioritize which concepts were most promising, balancing customer needs and Dropbox priorities
- _[Internally]_ Anchor a recently assembled team on real user problems firsthand, and stoke enthusiasm for solving the issues we uncovered
- _[Personally]_ Pilot participatory design-inspired methods in a workshop format


## Approach  
I chose to use workshops because they're inclusive for customers and teammates. The whole team could attend and talk to customers firsthand; and customers would have peers in the room to share the experience with. Co-creative research is also a great candidate for generative, strategic research – anytime we're determining what to build, and in what order. So, I designed workshops for 3 groups that ran in 2-part sessions: 

### Part I: Identify Problems & Prioritize Opportunities  

1. **Socialize Internal Participationt**<br>Since I was embedded on the team, I had enough context to do relatively informal conversations with the team about their needs and expectations. Instead, I channeled my efforts to socialize and evangelize that the workshops were happening so I could encourage cross-functional participation. 
1. **Design & Prep Materials**<br>One of the most challenging parts of co-creative design is ensuring that the materials can enable people outside the design team to participate in the design process, even if they have no experience. I designed artifacts for the first wave of workshops:
    - Handouts and a walkthrough deck explaining context, instructions, and examples 
    - An activity for participants to map their own workflows individually, including worksheets 
    - Activities for discussion and
