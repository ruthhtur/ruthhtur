# Coordination Automation Research  

There’s no such thing as a neutral technology. Elon Musk has said that artificial intelligence is mankind’s "[biggest existential threat](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x).” IDEO’s Tim Brown used the term “[augmented intelligence](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90147010/exclusive-ideos-plan-to-stage-an-ai-revolution)” to describe AI that focuses on “extending and enhancing people’s capabilities through technology.” Slack’s Stewart Butterfield has [said that he hopes for Slack to use AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608953/slack-ceo-how-well-use-ai-to-reduce-information-overload/) to help people understand their own cognitive biases and reduce information overload. 

## Goals  
From a Dropbox lens, **how do we think about — and design for — people that work in the context of “smart” technologies?**  What's our point of view, and how are we advancing people's goals in their own work via automation? 

To inform this, we designed research to identify attitudes and emotions people in our target market have about automation and smart technology as a whoole. We also needed to identify what people wished to automate in their lives, and what tasks they wished to keep for themselves.


## Approach  
We used two main methodologies to gather input: 

1. **Longitudinal: Diary Study**<br> We worked with 40 people in our target market to chronicle the tasks and activities they enjoy and don’t enjoy at work over 5 business days. We received over 1000 entries, and more than 600 photos of people’s work via a mobile app for collecting these photos. We used this approach since many coordination tasks, we hypothesized, are hard to track retrospectively, and are more accurately captured in the moment. 

1. **Co-Design and In-Person Interviews**<br> We did follow-up interviews with 12 people across Portland and New York to better understand the relationship people want to have with “smart” and “sophisticated” technology, and what opportunities Dropbox might have to help people work the way they want to using smart technology. We worked with them to identify opportunities based on their diary study entries – how might technology help them work the way they want to? What would the impact be? and then sorted subsequent opportunities into a framework developed by Christopher Noessel called [agentive technology](https://alistapart.com/article/fait-accompli-agentive-tech-is-here).
