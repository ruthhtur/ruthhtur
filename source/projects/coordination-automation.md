# Coordination Automation Research  

In late 2017, I lead a project with two other researchers investigating how we might approach intelligent technology as a company.  


## Goals  
From a Dropbox lens, **how do we think about — and design for — people that work in the context of “smart” technologies?**  What's our point of view, and how are we advancing people's goals in their own work via smart technology? 

Of course, there’s no such thing as a neutral technology. Elon Musk has said that artificial intelligence is mankind’s "[biggest existential threat](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x).” IDEO’s Tim Brown used the term “[augmented intelligence](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90147010/exclusive-ideos-plan-to-stage-an-ai-revolution)” to describe AI that focuses on “extending and enhancing people’s capabilities through technology.” Slack’s Stewart Butterfield has [said that he hopes for Slack to use AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608953/slack-ceo-how-well-use-ai-to-reduce-information-overload/) to help people understand their own cognitive biases and reduce information overload. 

We needed both **opportunities** as well as **principles**. To do this, we wanted to capture both attitudes as well as concrete places that more intelligent technology could improve people's lives. 


## Approach  
We used two main methodologies to gather inputs from creative workers:

1. **Longitudinal: Diary Study**<br> We worked with 40 people in our target market to chronicle the tasks and activities they enjoy and don’t enjoy at work over 5 business days. We received over 1000 entries, and more than 600 photos of people’s work via a mobile app for collecting these photos. We used this approach since many coordination tasks, we hypothesized, are hard to track retrospectively, and are more accurately captured in the moment. 

1. **Co-Design and In-Person Interviews**<br> We did follow-up interviews with 12 people across Portland and New York to better understand the relationship people want to have with “smart” and “sophisticated” technology, and what opportunities Dropbox might have to help people work the way they want. We worked with them to identify opportunities based on their diary study entries – how might technology help them work the way they want to? What would the impact be? and then sorted subsequent opportunities into a framework developed by Christopher Noessel called [agentive technology](https://alistapart.com/article/fait-accompli-agentive-tech-is-here).   

We used a co-creative mindset when designing activities with participants. It was important to us that participants _also_ walked away learning something or benefitting beyond an incentive. We built goals into the study to honor the contributions of participants, and stated goals for participants experience in several touchpoints like screening calls and the diary study. We also designed the self-reflective diary study to express both positive and negative aspects of peoples' worklives, so they could be mindful of what was working for them (or not). This was an excellent source of data thinking about ways to generate solutions, but also, many participants thanked us for the opportunity to reflect on their work lives.  

As we scoped the project, we conducted preliminary research from existing articles, both in mainstream publications as well as academic. We also met with over a dozen stakeholders conducting anonymous interviews on where they thought the industry was going, and where our company should go. These inputs were critical to make sure that our findings were relevant to Dropbox as well as resonant with the people who relied on them most.



## Findings & Outcomes 

Unfortunately I can't list the findings here, but I can detail what the general shape. We collected a tremendous amount of data, and we wanted to present it to our stakeholders based on what the organization should **do** about the opportunities we had identified. So, we designed our findings to include each of the following three attributes:

- Concrete examples of workflows that were good opportunities for smart technology  
- Principles and preferences reflected by participants for _how_ smart technology should intervene  
- Priorities and impact of potential smart technology innovations described by participants  

In addition to publishing an accessible, recommendation-oriented findings document, as well as making curated selections of our raw data available, we also toured several team meetings and had a "sneak peek" for our stakeholders. 


## In Retrospect

I have many ideas for things I'd like to add or include to similar studies in the future. One of the things that made this study successful was that when we generated opportunities with particpants, they were working with a record of their activities for a week so they could point out real examples or help us fill in the gaps if we missed any parts of their typical workweek. However, we could have built on this, and one possible extension of this work would be to do a workshop with both participants and Dropbox workers where we used the opportunities to co-design concepts. A future technology workshop would be ideal for this, and would be a way to both cement the insights in stakeholders as well as move further into design phase. 

Another strength was that we used a diary study tool in a mobile app, which participants both loved and loathed depending on the functionality. This strength became a weakness in some cases. 

Three things I'd do quite differently:

1. Increase impact by workshopping with stakeholders and/or participants to move from opportunities to concepts as quickly as possible.  
1. Use concepts created in workshops as one of the more powerful modes to communicate findings and opportunities.  
1. Use a tool that we're confident won't introduce confusion or irritation to participants' lives. We piloted it internally, but had not used it externally. 

Three things I'd do again: 

1. Build co-creative components into the study that set explicit goals for particpant experiences, and communicate them clearly.  
1. Prime conversations about smaller moments – like coordination tax – using similar longitudinal methods, even if only for a day. 
1. Sneak peek meetings, stakeholder interviews, and meeting tours were really effective to get a broad swath of colleagues aware and talking about the work.
