# The Atlassian Verified dashboard

I created a dashboard for add-on vendors using [Atlassian User Interface, or AUI](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/index.html). I coded high-fidelity mockups, and solicited feedback from designers and developers.

This dashboard conveys vendor status in relationship to [Verified program benchmarks](https://developer.atlassian.com/x/mIRjAQ). Atlassian Verified vendors uphold Atlassian standards for add-on support, Marketplace traction, and product compatibility.

## Goals

* Make individual requirement statuses obvious, so vendors can use this dashboard as a checklist on the way to becoming Verified.

* Wherever possible, provide options to update or modify information to minimize friction.

* On hover, show contextual tooltips that explain requirements and tips.

## Design

Not pictured here are tooltips for each field that describe the requirements in more detail, so vendors have context and information without needing to leave the page.

## Lessons learned

The dashboard has been a success. I've implemented changes in dashboard design, email notifications, and documentation in response to direct feedback from support and vendors. In retrospect, I should have initiated this feedback loop earlier on.

Quantitative assessments have been difficult to make since vendors are a relatively small group with specialized use cases. Metrics don't make a strong case for responsive design and this dashboard isn't optimized for mobile, but I'd like to explore this in the future.

Things I would have done differently:

* Always make sure all stakeholders are calibrated in their goals and expectations. Overcommunication is better than undercommunication. Every stakeholder should share the same definition of "success."
* Conduct user research with vendors before, during, and after to gauge success qualitatively.
* Work more directly with support during and after launch. Support insights can help assess if the dashboard is clear to use.
* Define quantitative success metrics before design and implementation.
