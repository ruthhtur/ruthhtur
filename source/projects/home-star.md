# Using Co-Design to Develop Features for Dropbox's Homepage 

In the summer of 2016, I worked as an embedded researcher on Dropbox's Home team to help identify and de-risk concepts for a new homepage on Dropbox's web platform. 

## Goals
For Dropbox:   

* **Identify possible concepts** <br> With an impending redesign of Dropbox's website, a previous concept for what the homepage should be fell through. What's possible? What should we rule out?  

* **Consider existing behavior on the platform.** <br> From previous research we knew that the web is largely used to get to files that aren't synced locally, or adjust settings (like shared folder membership) that aren't available.  

* **Move fast** <br> Come to a conclusion in a little over a month what concepts might be viable for a new homepage on the web. 

For me:  

* **Get the team to live and breathe the findings** <br> Use a methodology inclusive for stakeholders and design team. It was a high-profile project, and all involved needed to speak to the results with confidence.  


## Approach  
I selected co-design as a methodology, and recruited our target audience. We started with an active audience who used the web on a regular basis. 

* **Recruit in pairs** <br> I recruited pairs of collaborators – some in the same or different departments – since their team Dropbox makeup was relatively similar. Pairs are also a good idea because it helps participants feel at ease more quickly, and sometimes even reveals things that an individual interview would not just because pairs can chime in on each other's contributions.  

* **Ground findings in a tour** <br> One thing I often do to build rapport and get context about how people are working is to ask them to bring in their machines and show us a "tour" of how they're using Dropbox. When people can show us where and how they're using the product, we can better relate their stated or expressed desires in their current behavior.  

* **Build a UI kit that enables participation** <br> I needed people to be able to express their goals for what the front door to Dropbox might be like – what it might facilitate for them that our current home page did not, and what they wish they were able to do more easily. To this end, I assembled a UI kit with cut-out components that participants could use as a visual language while they talked through what they wanted to do.
