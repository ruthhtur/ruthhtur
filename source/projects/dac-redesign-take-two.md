# Redesigning Atlassian Developer Documentation & Remodeling IA

Our previous redesign of our developer documentation site  had technically lived up to its aspirations: 
It was on brand, and had a new layout. 
But, our brand guidelines quickly changed. Our typography guidelines, logos, and even illustration style 
changed in a short period, and our site looked dated. 

But that wasn't the only problem. Users we showed the site to complained that it looked like "any" site, but 
that it had a lot of jargon. When we asked them what the difference between 'cloud' and 'server' were, we 
got blank stares. We reskinned something, but the utility for users wasn't improved at all. 

We learned many things from the first redesign: 

- Set clear metrics from the outset of the project  
- Look at data _first_, before we start sketching ideas  
- Pair a data dive with qualitative research: What do people think of our current design?

Here's what it looked like before:

### What we did differently

We divided our goals into three parts: 

1. Where are people __already__ going on our site? (and, how can we help them get there?)  
1. What are people __searching for__ on our site? (and, how can we optimize for their terms?)  
1. What do we __want__ to show people on our site? (and, where does it belong with all these other goals?)  

For the first goal, we took a deep dive into Google Analytics. We looked at page hits, and divided them up 
by product. We realized we'd made a crucial mistake in the first redesign: People didn't conceptualize 
their development needs by SaaS or behind-the-firewall platform, they just thought about the _product_ they 
were developing for. We talked to customers at Summit, and found that people didn't care much about 
(or even know about) the deployment model, just the product they were working on. We saw data trends that 
clustered around certain products: High hits on JIRA, with Confluence coming in second. Everything else was 
basically small potatoes, and nobody was really going to sections "about" SaaS or server deployment. 

Then, we looked at what people were searching for. The documentation
