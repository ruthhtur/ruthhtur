title: Write the Docs retrospection
---

Great documentation isn't just great writing. Excellent documentation relies on principles of usability, visual design, development, typography, and content management. It's only possible for a doc writer to be marvelous if they understand user experience, development cycles, how to teach and learn from a (mostly static) webpage, and how to manage huge bodies of work that changes with every release. Despite these principle truths, it's tough to find a multidisciplinary approach to documentation, or even one that really puts readers at the heart of the conversation.

On the prowl for interesting conversations about how to make doc better, I attended [Write the Docs in Portland](http://conf.writethedocs.org/na/2013/index.html) last year. I was floored: there were talks on [Basecamp's](https://basecamp.com/help) information architecture overhaul and help center redesign. Matthew Butterick, creator of [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/), threw down a book in one of the most un-conference-y talks I've ever seen, bemoaning the state of text on the web. Kevin Hale of [Wufoo](http://www.wufoo.com) talked about creating a culture of support, where writers, developers, and designers all talked to customers. I was sold.

I volunteered with this year's crew of organizers, including [Eric Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/) of [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) and [Troy Howard](https://twitter.com/thoward37), who's devoted to making Twitter documentation the best in the world.

### The plan

Our aims were simple:

* Create a living, breathing community of people who care about reader experience and great documentation.
* Give this community access to excellent content.
* Ensure the content we provide is broad in scope, and doesn't dive down into tool-level intricacies. Every talk shouldn't be 100% relevant to every attendee, but every talk should have something that appeals to everyone.
