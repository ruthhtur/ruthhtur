    Design Researcher at Dropbox<br>
  </h1>
  <p class="subtext">
    Hi, I'm Ruth. I'm a design researcher working at Dropbox.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about translating people's needs into great designs. To me, research means being a fully-integrated 
    part of the design process. I collaborate closely with designers, engineers, product managers, 
    and writers. Great research recommendations mean concrete design directions, Sketch prototypes, or engagement models. </p>
    <p>I live in San Francisco, California. I'm relentlessly curious. Just like many of your favorite people, I binge-watch Netflix and complain about overpriced coffee. 
    I love fancy cheese and sarcastic jokes.</p>
    <p>
      I'm not currently looking for a job, but I'm always interested in meeting other researchers or learning how other companies approach 
      cross-functional design. </p>
