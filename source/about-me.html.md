# About Me

## How I Work

Close partnerships with design, engineering, and product management are symptoms of great 
research. Research shouldn't happen behind a curtain or just at the end of product 
development. You can measure research's efficacy by the decisions made about the product design, and that the team can speak with confidence about how and why we arrived at a great solution.  

I work with cross-functional teams to get concepts in front of customers as quickly as possible. 
I encourage paper prototyping and inclusive design, with internal and external participants, so that we can learn about core principles or ideas as early as we can.

## Other Details

I'm passionate about facilitating great design through research. 
I find that the best research is inclusive and collaborative, and brings users into early phases of the design process â€“ not just when there's something to evaluate.  

I live and work in New York, 
currently working with a team of amazing researchers and designers at Dropbox.

I hail from Portland, and bring a relentless sense of curiosity to any task or adventure. 

My favorite things to do are to learn new things, read a Sunday edition of the New York Times, and 
eat chips and salsa.
