# About me


I'm Ruth, and I'm passionate about facilitating great design through research. 
I find that the best research is inclusive and collaborative. 

I live and work in San Francisco, 
currently working with a team of amazing researchers and designers at Dropbox.

I hail from Portland, and bring a relentless sense of curiosity to any task or adventure. 

My favorite things to do are to learn new things, read a Sunday edition of the New York Times, 
eat chips and salsa, and sip fancy tequila cocktails.

## How I work

Close partnerships with design, engineering, and product management are symptoms of great 
research at work. Research shouldn't happen behind a curtain or just at the end of product 
development. 

I work with cross-functional teams to get concepts in front of customers as quickly as possible. 
I encourage paper prototyping and inclusive design, so that I can get the core principles of 
a feature or product in front of customers, especially if it's simply a sketch.

I work iteratively and lean,  working to ensure that my team can build on what we last learned. 
I define recommendations with stakeholders and collaborators, careful to balance a larger, 
strategic vision with iterative design and product management. 

I'm also addicted to whiteboards, post-its, and putting my processes and findings up in 
shared workspace.
