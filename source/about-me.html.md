# About me

I'm Ruth, and I currently live in San Francisco. I'm from Portland, Oregon; and appreciate 
good people, design, and food.

I'm genuinely passionate about improving people's experiences – with web interfaces, the 
world, and each other – and am lucky to call myself a researcher.  


## How I work

In short: Lean, scrappy, and inclusive. I work to demonstrate that research isn't a luxury – __it's a necessity__. 

I'm currently the sole US-based researcher for a company
with 1500+ employees and growing. I'm inclusive, not just because it makes sense to be 
resourceful, but because I'm determined to grow understanding, desire, and appreciation 
for research. I invite and encourage crossfunctional observers, notetakers, and synthesis 
participation; broadcast all my user interviews; and embrace transparency. 

Presently, I conduct evaluative and formative research, ranging from diary studies, usability 
tests, concept tests, interviews, contextual inquiries, surveys, and more. I'm always 
looking to learn more, and am currently focused on becoming great at running workshops 
and formative, generative research.  

## Who I am

A glutton for great food and interesting reading. Like your typical Oregonian, I'm 
addicted to [NPR](http://www.npr.org/), gourmet food, and cringe when I can't find a 
recycling receptacle. I'm not vegan, harbor no judgements toward those who are, and have 
no plans to change this. Sarcasm, dry humor, and self-awareness are my greatest flaws 
and assets.
