# About Me

I'm curious, witty, and committed to designing things for people that actually help them live the lives they want. I think great technology should enable more choices, and help people obtain their goals. 

- I love what I do. I'm extremely curious. I have high standards for how we treat one another at work. 

- I find that the best work comes out of circumstances where there are good processes and good people. 

- My favorite things to do are to learn new things, read a Sunday edition of the New York Times, and 
eat chips and salsa.

I mostly observe on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruth_buchanan). I sometimes post pictures of my dog on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ruth_buchanan/).
