# About Me

I love what I do. I'm extremely curious. I have high standards for how we treat one another at work. 

I find that the best work comes out of circumstances where there are good processes and good people. 

My favorite things to do are to learn new things, read a Sunday edition of the New York Times, and 
eat chips and salsa.
