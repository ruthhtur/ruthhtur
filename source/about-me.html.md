# About Me

I'm extremely curious. I'm committed to designing things for people that actually help them live the lives they want. I think great technology enables more choices for people.  

I find that the best work comes out of circumstances where there are good processes and good people. I have high standards for how we treat one another at work. 

My favorite things to do are to learn new things, read a Sunday edition of the New York Times, and 
eat chips and salsa.

I mostly observe on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruth_buchanan). I sometimes post pictures of my dog on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ruth_buchanan/).
