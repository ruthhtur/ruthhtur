### HipChat design research  
Worked on HipChat research intermittently from June 2014-present; worked cross-functionally 
with PMs, designers, engineers, Voice of the Customer, and data analysts. 

* __Onboarding & Growth: Biweekly interviews__  
  Interviewed 6-7 potential customers every other week with onboarding flows for new signups. 
  Interviews included concept tests, usability interviews, and comparative studies. Recruited cross-
  functional roles for observation, analysis, and notetaking. Presented insights and 
  recommendations, and iterated quickly on designs and scripts. 

* __Onboarding & Growth: General research__  
  Worked with teams to create in-page surveys for site visitors; arranged, facilitated, and 
  debriefed site visits; maintained email feedback channel; and other miscellaneous research 
  on HipChat onboarding and signups. Worked routinely with team to translate insights into 
  sketches, copy changes, and concepts.  

* __Files & search__  
  Interviewed 12 current users to understand how, why, and when they shared files or used search functionality in HipChat. Made recommendations that shaped roadmap development, and presented
  insights and recommendations to multiple teams.

### Confluence Diary Studies  
Ran a 10-working-day study with participants in the United States. Participants documented their journeys with Confluence using Tumblr, and responded to structured questions and templates. At the close of the study, worked with researchers to create a working engagement model, visual assets, and workshop materials.
