# Projects & Work

Here's a few projects that represent the way I work. You can also [view my CV](/resume/).

## Conference Talks

* [**Product Camp, June 2018**](https://2018.productcamp.pl/) <br> Co-speaker and workshop facilitator with Jennifer Brook in June 2018 on co-creative methods and practice at Dropbox.  
* [**Pixel Up, March 2018**](https://pixelup.co.za/) <br> Co-presented and lead a workshop with [Jennifer Brook](http://jenniferbrook.com/) on how we've been using participatory design and co-creative practice at Dropbox.

##Generative Design Research  
Examples of research designed and completed at early phases of product development, before concepts are defined or often even determined: 

* [**Smart Technology Research**](/projects/smart-tech/) <br> Using longitudinal and co-creative methodology, working with users to understand what they'd like to augment or automate in their worklives, and what kind of relationship with technology best suits their goals.  

* [**Participatory Design Workshops with Creative Workers**](/projects/nyc-codesign-workshops/) <br> I ran workshops in 2016 where customers self-identified and ideated around their most difficult problems working with files and collaborators, helping to anchor the team around which problems were worth solving – and how. 

* **Review Workflows Rapid Workshopping** <br> A multi-month workshop approach to determine a design strategy for how Dropbox should approach review workflows as a whole, with collaborators in both San Francisco and New York. 



## Conceptual Research
Projects where concepts were more concrete, but execution is still an open question: 

* __Dropbox Desktop Client__  
  Conducted concept tests, facilitated design sprints, ran surveys, and in-context interviews 
  to prioritize features for Dropbox on desktop; with a cross-functional team including 
  designers, PMs, and writers.  

* __Dropbox Recents__   
  Conducted concept testing with paper and interactive prototypes, ran surveys to measure people's goals on 
  dropbox.com, and contributed actively to product and feature strategy.  




## Archive: Former Projects  

* **Confluence Diary Studies**<br>  Ran a 10-working-day study with participants in the United States. Participants documented their journeys with Confluence using Tumblr, and responded to structured questions and templates. At the close of the study, worked with researchers to create a working engagement model, visual assets, and workshop materials. <a href="/projects/efi-diary">Insights and recommendations</a> | <a href="/projects/office-posters">Office posters</a>

* **Summit Test Lab** <br>Provided self-driven usability stations at Summit, our annual user conference. With 16 Macbook Pros, 10 volunteers, and over 2100 customers, we collected more than 200 videos of customers interacting with designs and prototypes.
